The website for my US Amateur Radio Operations callsign. Includes random info and projects about what I am interested in, working on, or have worked on in the past.

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

If you have jekyll installed, just `cd` and run `jekyll serve` to view at localhost:4000 or `jekyll build` for deployment.

Uses Google AMP and Bootstrap(a portion of it).
